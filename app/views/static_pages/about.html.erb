			<h2>Erik Hendricks</h2>
			<p>I think this is really important and on this tab, you can go NUTS with the photos, videos, stories about Erik, etc. Again - SO many people will be donating because they knew and loved your dad. While I think it's important to have homepage and Foundation content throughout the site elsewhere, this is where your dad's memory reigns and where people who knew him and loved him will come to remember him and celebrate him.</p> 
			<h2>Career</h2>
			<p>So... there couldn't be too many photos or too many quotes, memories, videos, etc.! Go nuts here. I am sure Thomas can build out a gallery with the photos/content you've given him, and then probably give you the keys to the castle with a little training and you can continue to build it out from there. </p>
